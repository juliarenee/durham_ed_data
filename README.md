# The Community Eligibility Provision: Food Insecurity in Durham Public Schools

By the end of last school year, students at Durham public schools had racked up over $209,000 in school lunch debt. That’s roughly 72,000 unpaid lunches—the most debt the district has seen in the past eight years.

When families can’t afford to pay for student lunches, school districts foot the bill. Debt tends to be concentrated in high-need schools, with more black and hispanic students than their low-debt counterparts. And while some of these schools are seeing their tabs skyrocket, others are cruising with no debt and free lunch for all. They are part of the Community Eligibility Provision.

Starting in the 2014-15 academic year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture launched the CEP program with a simple goal: Free lunch for every student. Schools that meet eligibility requirements and choose to participate offer all students free lunch, without the hassle of families filling out annual free and reduced lunch applications.

Ten Durham schools participated at the start of the program and saw quick results. Merrick Moore elementary school, which had over $21,000 of unpaid meals just two years earlier—or over $30 of debt per student—saw its debt drop to below $100 by the end of the school year.

Despite previously having been among those with the most unpaid meals, all 13 schools that now participate in the CEP program have zero debt.

But some Durham schools aren’t embracing the program. Last year, 12 of the 25 schools eligible for CEP status didn’t participate. And in June 2018, they accounted for just under 40 percent of all unpaid meals among the 51 public schools in Durham county.

With such a seemingly simple solution for feeding students, Durham’s lack of participation in the CEP program in the face of mounting debt raises questions about its feasibility and how local lawmakers are tackling food insecurity among high-need students. It’s possible that participation in the CEP program complicates other federal funding, such as Title I, at the school level.

As lunch debt continues to grow—and alongside it, concerns over lunch shaming and ambiguity about how the district will foot the bill amid poor education funding—I’m proposing multi-part series to explore the following questions:

* Why are CEP eligible schools not participating in the program?
* How has the program impacted school environment and student performance beyond debt?
* For nearly- and not-eligible schools, what are the challenges of debt and food insecurity?
* How does debt and need in Durham public schools compare with similar counties?
* Has CEP been a nationally successful program where enacted?

The series will require on the ground reporting in public schools, with a focus on educators and students. I will also talk with education policy experts about the impact of food insecurity on student achievement and well-being.

Durham’s lunch debt crisis has been covered by WRAL News, CBS 17, and Indy Week. However, none of this coverage provides the level of statistical analysis proposed in this series. Through merging datasets and records requests, I have already begun a longitudinal analysis of lunch debt and its relation race and need dating from the 2010-11 academic year to current.

Food insecurity is a major barrier to student achievement. The effects CEP—and drawbacks keeping schools from participating—holds major consequences for families of public school students, particularly those who struggle to pay for their child’s lunch. This deep-dive not only provides the chance to examine how this relatively new policy is affecting Durham, but create a framework for investigating CEP schools and school lunch debt in districts across the country.
